# Standardization in Data Preprocessing

This repository demonstrates the concept of standardization in data preprocessing, highlighting its impact on outliers and when it should be used in machine learning pipelines.

## Overview

Standardization is a crucial step in data preprocessing, especially for algorithms that rely on distance measurements. This repository explores the impact of outliers on standardization and provides a clear example of when to use standardization in your data preprocessing steps.

## Key Concepts

### What is Standardization?

Standardization (or Z-score normalization) transforms your data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is useful when you want to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations in algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

### Impact of Outliers

Outliers can significantly affect the mean and standard deviation of your data, leading to skewed results after standardization. This repository includes examples that demonstrate how outliers impact standardized data and how to mitigate these effects.

### When to Use Standardization

Standardization is recommended when:

- Your data is normally distributed.
- You are using algorithms that assume or rely on normally distributed data.
- The scale of features needs to be uniform (e.g., in k-NN, SVM, PCA).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed with the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
